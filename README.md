## Project Overview
**MediCare** is a clinic management and appointment system developed for the **Digital Egypt Pioneers Initiative (DEPI) .NET Full Stack track**. It brings doctor discovery, appointment scheduling, clinical records, prescriptions, and clinic administration into one ASP.NET Core MVC application.

The system streamlines Egyptian outpatient clinic operations by offering dynamic, conflict-free appointment scheduling with SQL Server concurrency protection, role-based portals for patients, clinicians, clinic administrators, and licensed pharmacists, real-time push notifications, digital prescription issuance with standardized print views, offline-safe server-side QR verification, clinical history and allergy tracking, automated 24-hour background reminders, and multi-format administrative analytics.

---

## Architecture at a Glance

MediCare separates the MVC presentation layer, application services, and data access into three projects. Controllers call service contracts rather than accessing the database directly.

## Local Development & Setup Guide

### 1. Prerequisites
- **.NET 8 SDK (LTS)**: Check version using `dotnet --version`
- **SQL Server**: Microsoft SQL Server 2022 or SQL Server Express / LocalDB (`MSSQLLocalDB`)
- **Git**

### 2. Clone and Checkout
```bash
git clone https://github.com/foxelhadad812-design/MediCare.git
cd MediCare
```

### 3. Environment & Secrets Configuration

MediCare differentiates security posture across runtime environments via standard `ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT` (`Development` vs `Production`).

#### Environment Differentiators:
- **Development Mode (`ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Development`):**
  - Cookie security allows `CookieSecurePolicy.SameAsRequest` to facilitate local development over HTTP without cookie drops.
  - Test Pharmacist account (`pharmacist@medicare.com`) is optionally seeded only if `Seed:PharmacistPassword` is provided in user-secrets.
  - Demo accounts are seeded only in Development. Set `Seed:DefaultPassword` in user-secrets before initializing a fresh local database; the application no longer uses a built-in demo password.
- **Production Mode (`ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Production`):**
  - Cookies enforce `CookieSecurePolicy.Always` with `Secure`, `HttpOnly`, and `SameSite=Strict/Lax`.
  - Administrator password **must** be provided via environment variable or Azure Key Vault and **strictly enforced to be at least 16 characters long**. Startup fails immediately if missing or weak.
  - Seeding of demo doctors, patients, mock appointments, and the Pharmacist account is **completely disabled**. Zero mock clinical data is generated. Pharmacist and doctor accounts must be provisioned individually through the Admin Panel.
  - HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) is enforced (365 days, preload, subdomains).

#### Managing Secrets via `dotnet user-secrets` (Development):
To ensure zero credentials are committed to source control, configure secrets locally:
```bash
cd src/MediCare.Web
dotnet user-secrets init

# Local database connection string (LocalDB):
dotnet user-secrets set "ConnectionStrings:DefaultConnection" "Server=(localdb)\mssqllocaldb;Database=MediCareDb;Trusted_Connection=True;MultipleActiveResultSets=true;TrustServerCertificate=True"

# Configure seeded account passwords:
dotnet user-secrets set "Seed:AdminPassword" "<YourStrongAdminPassword16CharsMin!>"
dotnet user-secrets set "Seed:PharmacistPassword" "<YourStrongPharmacistPassword!>"
dotnet user-secrets set "Seed:DefaultPassword" "<YourSecureDefaultPassword>"

# Optional AI Clinic Assistant (OpenAI or Azure OpenAI)
# Option A: Standard OpenAI
dotnet user-secrets set "AiAssistant:Provider" "OpenAI"
dotnet user-secrets set "AiAssistant:ApiKey" "<YourOpenAIProjectApiKey>"
dotnet user-secrets set "AiAssistant:Model" "gpt-4o-mini"
dotnet user-secrets set "AiAssistant:TimeoutSeconds" "15"

# Option B: Azure OpenAI
# dotnet user-secrets set "AiAssistant:Provider" "AzureOpenAI"
# dotnet user-secrets set "AiAssistant:ApiKey" "<YourAzureOpenAIApiKey>"
# dotnet user-secrets set "AiAssistant:Endpoint" "https://<your-resource-name>.openai.azure.com"
# dotnet user-secrets set "AiAssistant:Model" "<your-deployment-name>"
# dotnet user-secrets set "AiAssistant:TimeoutSeconds" "15"

# Optional: Configure trusted reverse proxy IPs (if running behind IIS, Nginx, or Azure Application Gateway):
dotnet user-secrets set "ForwardedHeaders:KnownProxies:0" "127.0.0.1"
```

#### Production Environment Variables:
In containerized or cloud environments (Azure App Service / Docker / Linux), configure via environment variables:
```bash
ConnectionStrings__DefaultConnection="Server=...;Database=...;"
Seed__AdminPassword="<StrongEnterpriseAdminPasswordAtLeast16Chars>"
ForwardedHeaders__KnownProxies__0="<ReverseProxyInternalIP>"

# AI Assistant Configuration (OpenAI or Azure OpenAI):
AiAssistant__Provider="OpenAI"
AiAssistant__ApiKey="<OpenAIProjectApiKey>"
AiAssistant__Model="gpt-4o-mini"
AiAssistant__TimeoutSeconds="15"

# For Azure OpenAI, provide Endpoint and deployment name:
# AiAssistant__Provider="AzureOpenAI"
# AiAssistant__ApiKey="<AzureOpenAIApiKey>"
# AiAssistant__Endpoint="https://<resource>.openai.azure.com"
# AiAssistant__Model="<deployment-name>"
```

> [!NOTE]
> **AI Safety, Privacy & Fallback Guarantees:**
> - **Zero Commits of Secrets:** Never commit API keys or credentials to version control. Keys are injected exclusively via user-secrets or environment variables (`AiAssistant:ApiKey`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, or `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY`).
> - **Explicit Consent Gate:** The user must explicitly tick the consent checkbox (`ConsentGiven`) before any prompt is processed. If unconsented, **zero external HTTP requests** are made and the system returns a consent requirement warning.
> - **Server-Side Medical Safety Interceptors:** Critical life-threatening emergencies (e.g., severe chest pain, shortness of breath, suspected stroke) are intercepted immediately by `MedicalSafetyGuard` and redirected to the **Egyptian Ambulance Service (123)** without calling external AI providers. Medication prescriptions are strictly refused.
> - **Egyptian PII Detection & Redaction:** Prompts are scrubbed of Egyptian National IDs (14 digits) and phone numbers (`010/011/012/015`) into `[REDACTED_NATIONAL_ID]` and `[REDACTED_PHONE]` by `PatientDataPrivacyGuard` before transmission.
> - **Ephemeral Transmission & Zero Raw Health Logging:** External API requests enforce `store: false`. Raw clinical text is never logged to application logs.
> - **Local Offline Fallback (Demo Mode):** If no API key is configured or the external service is unreachable, the system automatically falls back to deterministic local keyword analysis and tags the response with an explicit badge (`وضع تجريبي محلي`).

---

### 4. Apply Database Migrations
Run the EF Core database update from the repository root:
```bash
dotnet ef database update --project src/MediCare.Data --startup-project src/MediCare.Web
```

> [!NOTE]
> **Legacy Data & Payment Backfill Note:**
> Payment details for appointments marked as `Paid` prior to migration `20261009210023_AddAppointmentPaymentDetailsAndBackfill` are backfilled on a best-effort basis (extracted from historical 'Payment Received' in-app notifications where available, or deterministically populated with the appointment's original consultation fee, zero discount, and UTC audit timestamps).

---

### 5. Run the Application
```bash
dotnet run --project src/MediCare.Web
```
Open your browser at `https://localhost:7050` or `http://localhost:5066`, as configured by the HTTPS launch profile. On a fresh Development database, the initializer creates sample data. Configure the required demo-account password first.

#### Emergency CLI Account Recovery Command:
If an administrator or staff account requires an immediate lockout reset directly on the server console (without web UI access):
```bash
dotnet run --project src/MediCare.Web -- --recovery-unlock-user admin@medicare.com
```
This utility resets failed access attempts, clears the lockout timestamp, and exits immediately before starting the web server.

---

### 6. Run Automated Tests

Execute the automated test suites (545 tests across unit, calculation engine, DST timezone, clinical encounter, admin metrics, security, and SQL Server integration test suites):

```bash
# Run the entire test suite (including SQL Server LocalDB integration tests)
dotnet test MediCare.sln

# Run unit tests only (isolated in-memory and mock tests)
dotnet test MediCare.sln --filter "Category!=Integration"

# Run SQL Server filtered unique index and concurrency integration tests
dotnet test MediCare.sln --filter "Category=Integration"
```

> **Note on Integration Tests:** The integration tests verify the filtered unique index concurrency guarantees and optimistic concurrency token (`WHERE IsDispensed = 0`) against Microsoft SQL Server LocalDB (`(localdb)\mssqllocaldb;Database=MediCare_IntegrationTests`) or the container configured via `MEDICARE_TEST_CONNECTION_STRING`.

---

## System Roles & Access Control

| Role | Core Responsibilities & Capabilities | Lockout Policy |
|---|---|---|
| **Admin** | Clinic administration, doctor approval workflows, patient status & lockout toggles, pharmacist account creation, executive analytics, and RFC 4180 / Excel / PDF exports. | **Exempt from account lockout** to eliminate Denial of Service (DoS) risks; protected via IP-based rate limiting (5 req/min) and failed login audit warnings. |
| **Doctor** | Schedule & working hours management, leaves calendar, appointment confirmations/rejections, digital encounter charting, itemized digital prescriptions with QR code. | Standard lockout (5 failed attempts locks for 15 minutes). Admin or CLI can unlock. |

## Security Architecture & Engineering Trade-offs

1. **Admin Lockout Exemption vs IP Rate Limiting:**
   - *Rationale:* Enabling Identity account lockout on the sole clinic Administrator exposes the clinic to a trivial Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack where any anonymous attacker could lock the administrator out by submitting 5 wrong passwords.
   - *Defense-in-Depth:* Instead of account-level lockout, the login endpoint enforces a per-IP Fixed Window Rate Limiter (maximum 5 POST attempts per minute per IP). In addition, every failed administrator login triggers a high-severity `SECURITY ALERT` warning log (without logging passwords). In case of an emergency, the CLI switch `--recovery-unlock-user` can restore access on the host.

2. **Self-Hosted Vendor Assets & Data Privacy:**
   - *Privacy Protection:* To avoid sending patient health data or prescription verification tokens to third-party endpoints, routine application assets are self-hosted and sensitive records stay in the configured application storage. The optional clinic guide is the exception: if configured, it sends only the submitted chat message to OpenAI, with `store: false`; the UI warns users to use fictional data only.
     - Digital prescription QR codes are generated 100% server-side via `QRCoder` as inline PNG Data URIs (removing `api.qrserver.com`).
     - Chatbot avatar badges render locally generated SVG/HTML initials badges (removing `ui-avatars.com`).
     - Frontend vendor libraries (SignalR 8.0.7, Chart.js 4.4.1, FullCalendar 6.1.15, Leaflet 1.9.4 with local marker icons, Canvas Confetti 1.9.3, Bootstrap Icons 1.11.3) are self-hosted in `wwwroot/lib/`.
     - Typography fonts (Cairo & Inter) are self-hosted in `wwwroot/lib/fonts/` (removing `fonts.googleapis.com` and `fonts.gstatic.com`).
   - *External Network Boundaries:* External calls include map tiles (`*.tile.openstreetmap.org`), optional telemedicine rooms (`meet.jit.si`), optional OpenAI Responses API chat generation, and the user-initiated WhatsApp link below. The privacy page identifies these boundaries.
   - *Optional User-Initiated WhatsApp Reminders:* Appointment details include an optional, user-initiated WhatsApp button (`api.whatsapp.com/send?phone=...`) for patient appointment confirmation. This button opens WhatsApp in a new tab protected with `rel="noopener noreferrer"`. It is entirely client-side, optional, and never transmits clinical records or diagnoses.

3. **Content-Security-Policy (CSP) in Report-Only Mode:**
   - *Policy:* `Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only` and `Permissions-Policy` headers are emitted on every HTTP response.
   - *Trade-off:* Because legacy Razor views contain server-rendered inline JavaScript for dynamic calendar, chart, and modal event bindings, CSP is kept in Report-Only mode during auditing to avoid breaking frontend interactive charts without requiring complete nonce injection or bundle refactoring.

4. **Atomic Concurrency in Prescription Dispensing:**
   - *Protection:* To prevent race conditions and double-dispensing in busy pharmacy settings, `Prescription` employs an optimistic concurrency token (`[ConcurrencyCheck] public bool IsDispensed`).
   - *Database Invariant:* Dispensing queries issue an atomic `UPDATE ... SET IsDispensed = 1 WHERE Id = @id AND IsDispensed = 0`. SQL-backed concurrency tests are maintained in the suite; they require SQL Server LocalDB or `MEDICARE_TEST_CONNECTION_STRING`. See the dated test report for the most recent verification status.

5. **Mandatory Staff Password Change Enforcement:**
   - *Security Requirement:* When the clinic Administrator creates a staff account (such as a licensed pharmacist), the account is created with a temporary password and assigned the `MustChangePassword` claim.
   - *Enforcement Mechanism:* `MustChangePasswordMiddleware` intercepts authenticated requests across the application. Any staff user holding the `MustChangePassword` claim is strictly redirected to `/Account/ChangePassword` before accessing any clinical records, appointments, or prescriptions. Upon successful password update, the claim is removed and the user's security cookie is refreshed.

### Safe Demonstration Procedure for Evaluators / Committee

When demonstrating MediCare to evaluators or the graduation committee:
1. **Local Execution:** Run the application locally in Development mode (`dotnet run --project src/MediCare.Web`) with seeded demo credentials.
2. **AI Safety Verification:**
   - **Emergency Interceptor**: Send "أشعر بألم شديد وضغط في صدري" or "severe chest pain" and verify the immediate server-side redirection to **Ambulance 123** without calling external LLMs.
   - **Medication Refusal**: Ask "اكتبلي روشتة أو دواء للصداع" and verify the safety guard refusal.
   - **PII Protection**: Submit a prompt containing a 14-digit Egyptian National ID (e.g. `29801011234567`) and observe the privacy notice badge and redacted token `[REDACTED_NATIONAL_ID]`.
   - **Explicit Consent**: Observe that unchecking the consent box disables external transmission and returns a clear consent requirement warning.
   - **Local Demo Mode**: In the absence of an external API key, the system demonstrates full functionality using the deterministic **Local Demo Mode** (`وضع تجريبي محلي`).
3. **Role-Based Demonstration:**
   - **Admin (`admin@medicare.com`):** Review doctor credential approval, manage patients/lockouts, view executive analytics, and export Excel/PDF/CSV.
   - **Doctor (`ahmed.mahmoud@medicare.com`):** Manage weekly schedule and leaves, confirm/reject appointments, document clinical encounters, and print digital prescriptions.
   - **Patient (`khaled.omar@medicare.com`):** Search clinicians across governorates, view clinical records, download prescriptions, and check real-time SignalR notifications.
   - **Pharmacist (`pharmacist@medicare.com`):** Scan or enter prescription tokens at `/Prescriptions/Verify` and test atomic dispensing with concurrency protection.
