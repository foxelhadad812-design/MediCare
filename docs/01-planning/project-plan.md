## 6. MVP Scope Hierarchy & The Circuit-Breaker Rule

### 6.1 Priority Hierarchy If Time Becomes Constrained
If unexpected technical challenges or time constraints occur during development, tasks must be executed strictly according to this priority order:
1. **Priority 1 (Mandatory Core):** Appointment Booking with Slot Engine and Filtered Unique Index Conflict Detection.
2. **Priority 2 (Clinical Workflow):** Doctor Consultation Notes, Medical Records, Prescriptions, and Print Formatting.
3. **Priority 3 (Communications):** SignalR Real-Time In-App Alerts, followed by MailKit Email Confirmations.
4. **Priority 4 (Administration):** Doctor Approval Workflow, Specialization CRUD, and Chart.js Analytics.
5. **Priority 5 (Secondary Enhancements):** CSV Data Export, Theme/Dark-Mode toggle, Mock SMS integration.

### 6.2 The 20 November Circuit-Breaker Rule
> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Hard Engineering Rule:**  
> If the core appointment booking engine and double-booking conflict prevention are **not fully functional, concurrency-tested, and verified by 20 November 2026 (end of Sprint 2)**, all development of secondary features (analytics charts, CSV exports, theme polish) is **immediately frozen**.  
> The remaining development time will be dedicated solely to stabilizing the booking workflow, writing automated unit tests, executing database seeding, and deploying the stable core to Azure.
