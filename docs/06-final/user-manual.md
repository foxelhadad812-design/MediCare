# MediCare — Comprehensive User Manual & Operations Guide

## 1. System Overview & Persona Hierarchy

MediCare is an enterprise-grade clinic management and appointment booking platform built on ASP.NET Core 8 (.NET 8 MVC), Entity Framework Core, SQL Server, and SignalR. The platform supports three primary operational personas:

1. **System Administrator (`Admin`)**: Oversees clinic operations, verifies medical licenses, manages clinical departments, audits patient accounts, and exports analytics reports.
2. **Medical Clinician (`Doctor`)**: Manages clinical practice schedules, defines working hours, declares leaves, conducts consultations, and creates medical records and digital prescriptions.
3. **Patient (`Patient`)**: Discovers approved clinicians across Egyptian governorates, schedules consultations, reschedules visits, manages medical history and allergies, and receives real-time alerts.

## 2. Administrator Operations Guide

### 2.1 Dashboard & Intelligence Overview (`/Admin` or `/Admin/Dashboard`)
Upon authenticating with Administrator credentials, the system presents the operations dashboard:
- **Top Metrics Ribbon**: Total visits logged, active certified doctors, pending doctor licensing applications, completed visits, total paid revenue (EGP), and pending accounts receivable.
- **Monthly Clinical Trends**: Interactive 12-month visual charts tracking completed appointments, patient cancellations, and no-show occurrences.
- **Specialization Distribution**: Doughnut visualization illustrating appointment volume across clinical departments.
- **Financial Revenue Chart**: Stacked bar comparison of paid consultation fees versus unpaid/pending clinic fees.
- **Top Performing Clinicians**: Ranked league table displaying the top 5 doctors by consultation volume and revenue generation.
- **Patient Demographics & Cohort Analysis**: Aggregate distributions of patient gender and age brackets (`<18`, `18-35`, `36-50`, `50+`).

### 2.2 Doctor Licensing & Application Approvals (`/Admin/Approvals`)
To ensure medical safety, newly registered doctors cannot be booked until verified by an Administrator:
