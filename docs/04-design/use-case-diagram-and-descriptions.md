## 3. Detailed Use Case Specifications

---

### UC-04: Book Appointment Slot
* **Primary Actor:** Patient
* **Supporting Actor:** System Engine
* **Related Requirements:** FR-09, FR-10, FR-11, US-01, US-02
* **Preconditions:**
  1. Patient is authenticated with a valid `Patient` role session.
  2. Selected Doctor is approved (`IsApproved = true`) and has published active working hours.
  3. The chosen slot is at least 30 minutes in the future.
* **Main Success Scenario (Happy Path):**
  1. Patient navigates to the Doctor profile page and views the `FullCalendar.js` widget.
  2. The system calls the Slot Engine, returning unbooked 30-minute intervals for the selected date.
  3. Patient selects an unreserved slot (e.g., 10:30 AM – 11:00 AM) and clicks "Confirm Booking".
  4. The system validates slot availability via `IAppointmentService`.
  5. The system instantiates an appointment aggregate via `AppointmentFactory`.
  6. The system commits the appointment to the database in `Pending` status.
  7. The system saves a notification record to the database, then broadcasts an alert to the doctor via the `AppointmentHub` SignalR hub.
  8. The system returns a booking confirmation view displaying the appointment identifier, consultation fee, and pending status.
* **Alternative Flows:**
  * **Alt 1 (Concurrent Booking Conflict - Race Condition):**  
    At Step 4/6, another patient submits the same slot simultaneously. The second transaction encounters either a failed pre-check or a SQL Server `DbUpdateException` from the filtered unique index. The system catches the exception, rolls back the transaction, and returns an error: *"This slot has just been reserved. Please select another time."* The calendar immediately re-renders excluding that slot.
  * **Alt 2 (Doctor Added Emergency Leave):**  
    At Step 4, the doctor registered a leave between page render and submission. The system detects the date overlap, aborts booking, and displays: *"Doctor is on leave on the selected date."*
* **Postconditions:**
  * Appointment record exists in the database with status `Pending`.
  * The slot is removed from future availability queries.
  * The doctor's browser dashboard receives a real-time notification badge update.

---

### UC-05: Cancel Scheduled Appointment
* **Primary Actor:** Patient
* **Supporting Actor:** System Engine
* **Related Requirements:** FR-12, FR-13, US-06
* **Preconditions:**
  1. Patient is authenticated and owns the appointment (`appointment.Patient.UserId == currentUserId`).
  2. Appointment is in `Pending` or `Confirmed` status.
* **Main Success Scenario:**
  1. Patient accesses the "My Appointments" portal.
  2. Patient selects an upcoming appointment and clicks "Cancel Appointment".
  3. The system verifies the time constraint: Current Time is more than 2 hours before `AppointmentDate + StartTime`.
  4. The system updates the status to `Cancelled` and records the `UpdatedAt` timestamp.
  5. The system commits changes via the Unit of Work.
  6. The system persists an in-app notification and dispatches a SignalR notification to the Doctor.
  7. The system dispatches a cancellation confirmation email via `IEmailService`.
* **Alternative Flows:**
  * **Alt 1 (Late Cancellation Attempt):**  
    At Step 3, the scheduled start time is less than 2 hours away. The system rejects the operation and displays: *"Appointments cannot be cancelled within 2 hours of the start time. Please contact the clinic directly."* Status remains unchanged.
* **Postconditions:**
  * Appointment status is `Cancelled` (a terminal state).
  * The 30-minute slot is immediately restored as available on the doctor's calendar.

### UC-06: View Medical Records & Print Prescription
* **Primary Actor:** Patient
* **Related Requirements:** FR-16, FR-19, US-04, US-05, NFR-SEC-01
* **Preconditions:**
  1. Patient is logged in.
  2. Target `MedicalRecord` has been generated by the attending physician following a completed consultation.
* **Main Success Scenario:**
  1. Patient navigates to the "Medical History" section and clicks on a completed visit record.
  2. The system executes the IDOR verification check: verifies `record.Patient.UserId == currentUserId`.
  3. The system renders the clinical encounter view showing symptoms, diagnosis, doctor notes, and links to attached diagnostic reports.
  4. Patient clicks "Print Prescription".
  5. The system renders the clean CSS `@media print` layout displaying the clinic header, physician credentials, medication list, dosages, and signature block.
  6. Patient triggers browser print to produce physical paper or save as a local PDF.
* **Alternative Flows:**
  * **Alt 1 (Unauthorized IDOR Access):**  
    At Step 2, a patient manipulates the URL parameter (e.g., `/MedicalRecords/Details/89`) where record 89 belongs to another user. The ownership validation fails. The system halts execution, returns `HTTP 403 Forbidden`, and logs a security violation with the requesting user ID.
* **Postconditions:**
  * Patient reviews their clinical history without exposing data to unauthorized parties.

### UC-08: Register Vacation / Absence Leave
* **Primary Actor:** Doctor
* **Related Requirements:** FR-08, US-03
* **Preconditions:**
  1. Doctor is authenticated and approved.
* **Main Success Scenario:**
  1. Doctor navigates to the "Schedule Management" tab and selects "Add Leave / Vacation".
  2. Doctor inputs `StartDate`, `EndDate`, and optional `Reason` (e.g., "Medical Conference").
  3. System validates that `EndDate >= StartDate` and `StartDate >= Today`.
  4. System saves the record in `DoctorLeaves`.
  5. System informs the doctor of any pending appointments overlapping the leave dates so the doctor can manually review and reschedule them.
* **Alternative Flows:**
  * **Alt 1 (Invalid Date Range):**  
    Doctor specifies an end date preceding the start date. FluentValidation returns a validation error and halts submission.
* **Postconditions:**
  * Record created in `DoctorLeaves`.
  * Future calls to the slot engine for dates within the range will generate 0 slots.

### UC-11 & UC-12: Record Consultation & Issue Digital Prescription
* **Primary Actor:** Doctor
* **Related Requirements:** FR-12, FR-14, FR-15, FR-17, FR-18, US-04
* **Preconditions:**
  1. Doctor is authenticated.
  2. Appointment is assigned to this Doctor and is currently in `Confirmed` status.
  3. Appointment scheduled time has arrived or passed (`StartTime <= DateTime.UtcNow`).
* **Main Success Scenario:**
  1. Doctor opens the patient consultation view for the active appointment.
  2. Doctor inputs symptoms, diagnosis, and clinical notes.
  3. (Optional) Doctor uploads a diagnostic scan or laboratory report (JPG, PNG, or PDF ≤ 5 MB). The system validates the MIME type and saves the file to `wwwroot/uploads/records/` under a unique GUID filename.
  4. Doctor adds prescription items: Medication Name, Dosage, Frequency, Duration, Instructions.
  5. Doctor clicks "Complete Consultation & Save Prescription".
  6. The system transitions the Appointment state to `Completed`.
  7. The system creates the `MedicalRecord`, `Prescription`, and child `PrescriptionItems` within a single atomic database transaction.
  8. The system redirects the Doctor to the printable prescription view.
* **Alternative Flows:**
  * **Alt 1 (Early Completion Attempt):**  
    Doctor attempts to complete an appointment scheduled for tomorrow. The system blocks the transition: *"Appointments can only be completed after the scheduled consultation time has arrived."*
  * **Alt 2 (Invalid File Upload):**  
    Doctor uploads an executable file (`.exe`) or a file exceeding 5 MB. Server-side validation rejects the file with an informative error message.
* **Postconditions:**
  * Appointment status is permanently set to `Completed`.
  * Medical record and prescription are saved and accessible to the patient.
