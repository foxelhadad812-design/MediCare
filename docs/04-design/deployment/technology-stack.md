## 2. Selection Rationale by System Tier

### 2.1 Backend Architecture (.NET 8 + ASP.NET Core MVC)
ASP.NET Core MVC was chosen over a decoupled SPA (e.g. React/Angular) to minimize framework bloat and eliminate client-side state synchronization overhead. Server-side rendering guarantees that HTML views, Identity cookie authentication, and Anti-CSRF tokens remain unified under a single, cohesive request pipeline.

### 2.2 Relational Data Tier (SQL Server & EF Core 8)
Healthcare scheduling demands absolute transactional consistency. Non-relational (NoSQL) stores rely on eventual consistency, which introduces unacceptable race conditions when booking shared doctor slots. SQL Server’s support for **Filtered Unique Indexes** (`WHERE Status NOT IN (3, 4)`) provides the exact mechanism required to prevent double-booking without blocking re-booking of cancelled slots.

### 2.3 Real-Time Communications (ASP.NET Core SignalR)
SignalR eliminates polling overhead. By utilizing strongly-typed hubs (`IAppointmentNotificationClient`), the backend triggers instant client-side UI refreshes and toast notifications whenever appointments are scheduled, confirmed, or cancelled.

### 2.4 Business Validation (FluentValidation)
Standard MVC `[DataAnnotation]` attributes quickly clutter view models when business rules involve multi-property logic (e.g., "Doctor leave `EndDate` must be greater than or equal to `StartDate`"). FluentValidation centralizes these business invariants within `MediCare.Services` where they can be thoroughly unit-tested in isolation.
